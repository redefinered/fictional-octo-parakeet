            </p>

            <h2>3. Data Storage and Security Measures</h2>
            <p>
                Your data is stored securely using Firebase (Google Cloud Platform). In compliance with the Data Privacy Act, we implement appropriate technical, physical, and organizational security measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.
            </p>
            <h3>3.1 Technical Security Measures</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Encryption of data in transit using SSL/TLS protocols</li>
                <li>Encryption of sensitive data at rest</li>
                <li>Secure authentication and access controls</li>
                <li>Regular security assessments and updates</li>
                <li>Firewall and intrusion detection systems</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3.2 Organizational Security Measures</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Access controls and user authentication</li>
                <li>Employee training on data privacy and security</li>
                <li>Confidentiality agreements with personnel</li>
                <li>Regular review and update of security policies</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
            </p>
            <h3>3.3 Data Breach Notification</h3>
            <p>
                In the event of a personal data breach that may pose a risk to your rights and freedoms, we will notify the National Privacy Commission (NPC) and affected data subjects within 72 hours of discovery, in accordance with the Data Privacy Act. We will also take immediate steps to mitigate the breach and prevent further unauthorized access.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
            <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information in the following circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Public Information:</strong> Parking spots you add, reviews, and ratings are visible to other users of the app. This sharing is necessary for the app's core functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share data with third-party service providers (e.g., Firebase, Google Maps) who assist in operating our app. These providers are contractually bound to protect your data and use it only for specified purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, court order, or government regulation, or to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of our users.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred to the new entity, subject to the same privacy protections.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4.1 Cross-Border Data Transfer</h3>
            <p>
                Your data may be stored and processed in servers located outside the Philippines (e.g., Google Cloud Platform servers). When we transfer data across borders, we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contractual agreements with data processors that include data protection clauses</li>
                <li>Verification that the receiving country has adequate data protection laws, or</li>
                <li>Implementation of additional security measures to protect your data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By using our service, you consent to the transfer of your data to these locations, subject to the safeguards described above.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Location Data</h2>
            <p>
                Location data is essential for our app to function. We only collect location data when you grant permission. You can revoke location permissions at any time through your device settings, though this may limit app functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Location data is used to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Show nearby parking spots on the map</li>
                <li>Provide navigation directions to parking spots</li>
                <li>Allow you to add new parking spots at your current location</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Our app uses the following third-party services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> For authentication, database, and storage services</li>
                <li><strong>Google Maps:</strong> For map display and navigation features</li>
                <li><strong>Payment Processors:</strong> For processing payments (GCash, PayPal, Stripe) when payment features are available</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These services have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to understand how they handle your data.
            </p>
